The Crowdfunding Smart Contract is designed to enable users to contribute towards a fundraising goal in a decentralized manner. This contract ensures transparency and security by utilizing Ethereum's blockchain technology. Contributors can fund the campaign, and if the fundraising goal is met, the contract allows the owner to withdraw the collected funds. If the goal is not reached by the deadline, contributors can claim refunds.
